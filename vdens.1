.SH DESCRIPTION

vdens creates a user namespace with a private network namespace.

Vdens launches the command indicated as a parameter ($SHELL if omitted) in a private network namespace.

If the vde_network parameter is present (and it does not match one of the
strings "-" or "no") the virtual private network namespace will have a virtual
interface connected to the specified vde network. The name of the virtual interface
is "vde0" unless a different name has been specified by the \fB-i\fR parameter.

Vdens grants the capabilities CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, CAP_NET_BROADCAST, CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_RAW to the command to
permit the configuration of the virtual interface. The scope of these
capabilities is limited to the user namespace created by vdens. Once the network has been
configured, the capabilities can be dropped (e.g. using csdrop(1)) in order to
increase the security (obeying to the principle of least privilege).

.SH NOTES
Use of user namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with the CONFIG_USER_NS option.
In some distributions (e.g. Debian) user namespaces must be enabled by writing 1 to
/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone.
